Welcome to the AssassinVictim wiki!

Device to run : iPhone > 8.1

After installing the application, user should create an account (with email& password). Then user can use this credentials to login. At the main page of the game user should select a type (assassin or victim)

When user selects victim, her/his victim user is created on Parse, but victim user flow is not implemented. (so victim will be seen on the map but victim user won't be playing -> which means victim can only die ^^)

When user selects assassin role-> an assassin user is created on Parse with the default type of gun revolver, with 15 damage hit points) map view is opened with victims pinned on it.

User can select any victim on map, if the victim is further then 5 kms (this can be changed inside the code) then victim can not be shoot, assassin should get closer to kill the victim.

If the victim is inside 5 kms range assassin can start shooting (for each shoot this is checked again)

If assassin shoots enough victim is dead!
